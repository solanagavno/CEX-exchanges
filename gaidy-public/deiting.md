{% hint style="info" %}
Let's look at an example of a legend:

* we are a young girl of about 20-25 years old, nice looking, but without being too over the top;
* we live in Europe, ideally the Czech Republic, Sweden, Romania, etc. This is to avoid having to explain why your English is so weak and not to arouse suspicion if you have poor language skills;
* no hint of begging, work/study. Independent and self-sufficient;
* Very few hints of intimacy. We are a proper, naive and shy girl with unspoiled mind and pure soul. So more trust and a lot easier to remember and "get into the soul" mammoth from abroad.
{% endhint %}

For the full beauty of this scheme, you need to find a voice pack and a photo pack. Better yet, find a girl to help you in this endeavor. Probability of success +100.

**Search sites:** Match.com, Tinder, OkCupid, Mylove, Mamba, Badoo, Juliadates, eDarling, Teamo, Fdating and any others.

I recommend to create at once several profiles on the same name on different sites, because the confirmation of the questionnaire you need to wait.. I advise you to use high-quality paid proxies, adjusting them to the country specified in the questionnaire.

When filling out the questionnaire make a bias on the image of the usual simple calm girl without any excesses.

**Scheme:** With a normal questionnaire and site, mammoths will write themselves in huge numbers. You can even buy premium on the site. Mandatory condition, each mammoth to warm up at least 2-3 days. Do not sit over one mammoth, you can parallel warm up 10-20-30-50 mammoths, it will bring you a very powerful profit. Distracted communication about work, study, travel, different countries, inquiries about his work, personal life, plans for the future, any topics that will be neutral.. Politics, religion is desirable not to touch on that would not scare off the mammoth unnecessary statement.\
Flirting should also be done carefully, not too provocative.
{% endhint %}

**There are two options now.**

\*\* The first one \*\*

At the moment of warming up you begin to sharply throw in some details about expensive purchases, branded expensive things, cars, expensive restaurants (the mammoth will immediately have a blubber in his head, how come, you are just a student or work at a regular job). In general, bait him on the question of where you do get the money.\
Only after he asks, you tell the story that you met some trader, and he gives you free instructions on how to make money on crypto. And they say that everything is so transparent and simple (you can link the P2P arbitrage scheme here) that even you figured it out, even though you never had any experience at all. You can also tell him about these bundles or even better, tell him that you have limits today because of the volume of trades and if he can help you spin one bundle. And if he helps you, you will tell him the bundles too. Then comes the method described in the P2P scheme, when we credit some amount of deposit to the mammoth, and after the operations that you prompt him, he withdraws to your wallet already a larger amount. But in this case it is better to send him from 1000$, in order to strike him in the next steps to make the same deposit. At this stage, he lights up and you start to spin it on the scheme further.

\*\*Second \*\*

Ask the mammoth if he understands financial transactions and so on. If he says yes, or even better asks what kind of help he needs - we tell him that we met a young man, he is some kind of investor from Switzerland, and he sent money for the road to him in crypto, but we can not change this money into dollars, because with crypto experience we have 0.

Then we offer to give him the login and password from our account on the exchange, in order to avoid the fear of phishing at the mammoth.

Further on the scheme. In front of him make a complete fool of himself, which does not understand anything. On behalf of tech support, we communicate exclusively beautifully, officially, politely - as always.\
We try to use different styles of communication, so that the mammoth did not realize that the same person writes it.

To get ahead of the question why we do not address the person who sent us the money - before kkk to speak for crypto, we can say that he transferred the money a week ago, and literally 3 days as the connection with him disappeared, because he is on a business trip or on vacation, and does not go to the site, and time is running out, it's time to buy tickets and prepare for the trip. And in general, if he is missing, you will gladly thank the mammoth that you can come to him if he helps you.

But one way or another to push the mammoth is not worth it, this is the most famous sign of scammers.\
It is desirable to give him an account with a pre-prepared fake transfer history and with a stupid correspondence with tech support, where support explained everything to you correctly and correctly, and you, according to your image, did not understand anything.\
It is desirable to continue to maintain a conversation on other topics, you should not rush the mammoth and write "when everything will be ready?!". On all questions say that you do not know anything and do not understand anything at all.

# üêå Buying ads from Instagram/YouTube bloggers

{% hint style="info" %}
Here we will slightly reciprocate the method of work from adverters (people who spam with the purpose of throwing a mammoth styler and stealing a youtube channel). But let's turn the whole method of work on our way, and believe me, you can make profits here much more interesting than on advert.
{% endhint %}

Due to the niche development, if you search well, you can find reggers and spammers of email services, instructions and manuals on email spam, as well as parsers Youtube channels.

What is the essence of our work? Everything is simple, we register mail, compose a letter, parsing a huge number of channels and send out messages - get answers. Those who are interested, the second letter - we offer to go to Whatsapp or Telegram.

All as usual, we introduce ourselves on behalf of any company or product (at the initial stages, you can even find an existing company, but with which you can not contact, that would not make lending and so on) and tell about yourself, your company, your product (the best company related to any services, digital courses or any other universal theme, which will fit the theme of any channel). Tell about the fact that you have charged a huge budget for marketing, and want to increase the recognition of your company.\
Ask the terms of advertising on their channel, options and cost.\
Then, if the amount for placement is too small - offer to sign a contract for a month or six months to increase the cost of payment or n-th number of publications.

Remember that the more you charge a mammoth amount of money - the better. But that doesn't mean you should take the numbers off your head. The money has to be "earned."

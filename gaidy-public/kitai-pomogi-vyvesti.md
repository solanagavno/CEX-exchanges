# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China/Help Withdraw

Probably the oldest and most known scheme in crypto-scam at the moment. Moreover, the chance to find a mammoth now on it is still high! You just fall for a fool under the guise of a Chinese and try to breed a mammoth for cache.

My personal opinion is that the legend itself is very dumb, but in skillful and diligent hands it is quite profitable. So it has a place here.

\*\* Find your victim and build a dialog with her in this way.

\- Hi, I found you in the chat room, I need help, can you help me?

\*\*After the victim answers you and asks you how he can help you?! - Answer something like this.

\- Hi, I'm from Europe, but due to work I had to go to China for an indefinite period of time. I have money on a cryptocurrency exchange, but I can't withdraw it because cryptocurrencies are banned in China. (Come up with whatever the fuck you want with China, you can also come up with something else with the crown pandemic). Finish by offering the victim 10-20% for agreeing to help you.

\*\*Further if the victim goes to help us and registers on the site, charge them a certain amount of money. Let the mammoth realize that the money is real and you really need it. There should be no doubt in his mind that the money is real.

\*\*After the mammoth fails to withdraw the cache due to an error. Say that you don't know why this happened and ask for a solution to the problem. Through the helpdesk get the victim to deposit.

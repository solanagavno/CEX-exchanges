# üéÅ Pranks / Giveaway

This scheme is the most automated among the others, which makes it possible to get profit practically on the passive.

**Important! You should work on this scheme only on personal domains.**

Your task is to make a mass spam mailing to the target audience. In the text of the message you need to indicate that the user won some amount of cryptocurrency on our site.

Only Telegram and Discord are suitable for mailing. Chat topics should be either cryptocurrency or business and financial. There is no point in posting on other topics.

\*\*What do I need to work?

First of all, you will need a lot of accounts, because it is inevitable that they will often fly to the block. To minimize losses dilute your text mailing, either manually, or use services randomizers.

**Most importantly link to our site always shorten in the mailing via bitly.com or similar services** (No need to unnecessarily scare the domain, as well as the link will not fly away to check).

In order not to jerk all messages manually use software for mailings. What exactly to use - I can not advise, they are a lot. Paid/free, each has its own pros and cons, you decide.

**Example text of the message:**

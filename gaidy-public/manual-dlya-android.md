# ðŸ“± Manual for Android

**Steps to customize:**

* Preferably reset your Android device to factory settings. But if you can't do that - pull out the SIM card and reset the network settings.
* Go to the phone settings, set the language/region/time the same as the geo on which we pour.
* Install SocksDroid. We insert proxy in SocksDroid format (ip,port,log,pass) and check whoer.com. You can also use VPN (PureVPN/Cyberghost/Ivacy/PIA).
* Next, download the link [**TikTok mod and plugin**](https://t.me/+JjjUwN4bvi9dlOTFi). First download the plugin, then the .apk of tiktok.
* Go into the plugin and select the geo you are streaming, optionally select forced display of recommendations for the selected geo (not all work).
* In the right-bottom corner click open **TikTok**.

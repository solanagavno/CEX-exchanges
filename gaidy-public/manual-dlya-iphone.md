# 🍏 iPhone Manual

### \*\*First, let's get your iPhone ready for use.

Remove the SIM card from the phone. Also log out of iiklaud and register it. It is desirable to take trust mail (gmail/outlook), but you can also take any temp mail. We buy number on [**5sim**](https://5sim.biz), [**sms-activate.** ](https://sms-activate.org)We take EU geo, we can take for example France.

Then do the following:\
General - Language Region - Region - set the geo we're going to cast. General - Transfer or Reset Iphone - Reset - Reset Network Settings

After rebooting, download Potatso, you can also use VPN for uploads, for example PureVPN/NordVPN. To download we will be asked to write the password from iCloud and fill in the data for registration, there we write any values.

They can be bought in any shop with lolza.\
Connect proxy in Potatso (if we use proxies). Insert ip, port, log, pass or connect VPN and download TikTok.

**Further: Signing up for an account ->**

Let's get to the bottom line.\
You have leaked your account, delete tiktok. If you spill the same geo, download back tiktok and register a new account. If there is a shadow on the account, reset network settings and SSID (the name of your WiFi network, done in the settings of the router).\
(General - Transfer or Reset Iphone - Reset - Reset Network Settings), (network should be reset about once every 3-5 accounts). And change the proxy/VPN. If you change the geo, respectively change the region in the iPhone and the country of the proxy/VPN.

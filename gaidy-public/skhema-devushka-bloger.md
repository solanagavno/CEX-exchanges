# üë©‚Äçü¶∞ Schema "Girl Blogger"

Interesting scheme related to social networks, does not require almost any skills and investments, but you will need to spend a little time to prepare. The essence is simple - find more or less popular girl blogger, borrow her content on the design of your account. Do not need to post everything in one minute, it will take a little time to publish content evenly, so as not to arouse suspicion and not to grab the account ban. Continuously post different stories - download a girl's story - then post it to your story. The profile should look lively and realistic to inspire trust in the victim.

The fastest way to attract an audience is to buy advertising. Target run I think there is no point, it is better to buy advertising from other girls bloggers. Beginning bloggers already have a certain audience and they do not put a cosmic price tag on advertising.

After you have the first audience - throw the story "–º–æ–ª cryptocurrency exchange on my affiliate link/promo code gives away 800-900$, sign up soon", something like that.

This way you will immediately get up to a hundred interested mammoths, further we already breed them according to the established scheme - communication in the support, chat.

Investments in advertising will pay off quickly. Roughly speaking, with the right approach with 40-50$ can make more than 1000$ per day.

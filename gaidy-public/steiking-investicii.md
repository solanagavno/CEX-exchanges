I will not spell out this scheme of work to the details, as it would take a lot of time and text. The task is to find people who are looking for investment in your project, contact them on behalf of a private investor, dosed to show interest in the potential of the project. It is also necessary to show your expertise, it will not be superfluous to give some recommendations on the topic. Try to read a little about private investors and business angels in general. What is this category of people, what they do, how they communicate. The dialog should be built in such a way that it is not you who wants to give the victim money, but the victim must first earn money from you. Warm up, communicate, ask sharp questions, push your "expertise". If the requested investment amount is not large, try to logically increase it by multiples, explaining that their idea and business needs a wider reach (we will need this to make it easier for the victim to make Deposits). Once the victim has earned your attention and interest, take a short pause before making a major decision. Then come back and say the desired for him - "Yes" and give him a word of encouragement, inspire him, because what he longed for so long will soon be realized. Find an example of an investment agreement on the Internet, tweak it for yourself and offer it to the victim to sign. And when the contract is signed, the next step is payment. Here it is necessary as always, show a little ingenuity, depending on your legend - who you are and where from.. As an option will fit the classic message that because of the withdrawal of a large amount of funds, the withdrawal of money to an external wallet for you will not be available soon, you can send money inside the exchange, so you are recommended to register on it. You could withdraw money to your second wallet, which is linked (verified) on the exchange, but lost access to it, so this option falls away by itself (by doing this you will also prepare the mammoth to the fact that the wallet must be verified).\
The victim registers the wallet, sends it to you, you credit him the long-awaited money.

\
Then he tries to withdraw, first he needs to verify the account through documents, well, and then verify the external wallet for withdrawal. The minimum deposit in this case, you can bet from 1000$ with the corresponding processing of the mammoth and a large amount on his wallet.. Again, options why he needs to make a deposit, and even such a large enough variety. Under a similar scheme, you can also make the first deposit of 2-3k$ and I personally worked on such a scheme. However, there is no sense to scare away the mammoth, and you can get 5 times more out of it, competently working on behalf of technical support.

This scheme requires more experience, SI skills and training. However, with competent work can give very good profits. But this does not mean that this scheme is the only way to work. You can complicate it or, on the contrary, simplify it considerably, change the approach to suit yourself. It is not always the case that a long and lengthy preparation for work means that you will earn more.
